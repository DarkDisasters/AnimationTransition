"LP.LPI.CUST.RK","","Efficiency of the clearance process, rank (1=highest performer)","","The Logistics Performance Index reflects perceptions of a country's logistics performance based on six components. The component ""Efficiency of the clearance process"" includes results from the survey question ""Rate the efficiency of the clearance process (i.e. speed, simplicity and predictability of formalities) by border control agencies in country [x]."" Data are from the Logistics Performance Index surveys conducted by the World Bank in partnership with academic and international institutions and private companies and individuals engaged in international logistics. The 2018 round of surveys covered close to 6,000 country assessments by around 1,000 international freight forwarders. Respondents evaluate eight economies on six core dimensions on a scale from 1 (worst) to 5 (best). The economies are chosen based on the most important export and import markets of the respondent's country, random selection, and, for landlocked countries, neighboring countries that connect them with international markets. Scores for the six areas are averaged across all respondents and aggregated to a single score using principal components analysis. Details of the survey methodology and index construction methodology are available in Arvis, Ojala, Wiederer, Shepherd, Raj, Dairabayeva, Kiiski: ""Connecting to Compete 2018: The Logistics Performance Index and Its Indicators"", see Appendix 5 for methodology.","","","","","","","","","World Bank Logistics Performance Index Surveys.
